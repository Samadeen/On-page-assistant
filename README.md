This is a repository I used to write a tutorial on Medium about how to render a GLTF 3D model using Next.js, TypeScript, react-three-fiber and react-three-drei.

You can check it out [here](https://medium.com/@valentinagaravaglia/rendering-a-3d-model-with-next-js-13-typescript-react-three-fiber-and-react-three-drei-84476c3b6a5d).

This is the final result:

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
